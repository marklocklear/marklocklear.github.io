        I am a <a href="http://vetswhocode.io/"  target="_blank">mentor</a>, teacher and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/news/instructor-and-student-co-author-web-development-book"  target="_blank">author</a> who loves software development. Truth be told mentoring and teaching are my passions and software development is only medium for me to accomplish that, but solving problems with code is a close second. I teach <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/csc/java-programming" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/dba/mysql-db-programming-ii"  target="_blank">Rails</a> at my local Community College. The positions I have held over the last 20 years are LAN Administrator, QA Engineer, and most recently Web Developer. I still like doing all of those things when the opportunity presents itself. The <a href="http://www.learningrails5.com/foreword"  target="_blank">foreword</a> from Learning Rails 5 will give you a sense of how I came to software development and Rails. You can get a sense of my skill level by reading my Stackoverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=questions"  target="_blank">Questions</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=answers"  target="_blank">Answers</a>.

        Outside of software I like just but anything I can do with my hands. I am into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/oJOopOsZ9c"  target="_blank">salvaged metal art</a>, gardening, <a href="http://locklear.me/motorcycle/index.html"  target="_blank">motorcycle restoration and fabrication</a>, old <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/bfc83a77-1cac-4da3-bf21-effe1eecb616"  target="_blank">volkswagens</a> and home brewing. I love the NFL (Go Panthers) and NBA, but hate baseball (not enough action). I am a <a href="http://www.lumbeetribe.com/"  target="_blank">Lumbee Indian</a> and adore my wife and three year old daughter. Also, I taking a Graphic Design class and am enjoying learning the Adobe Suite of products which are all new to me.

        You are Basecamp (37Signals). You are THE gold standard for a web development company, and a Rails shop. I would be honored to work with you and be a part of creating great software, and making the world a better place. I would never describe my Rails skills as "Rockstar", but I do like to think as a human being I am a rock star.

        I love that Bascamp sees value in diversity and what that can bring to software development and business. As part of the programming class that I teach I include a writing assignment where students are required to read an article on Diversity and Technology. They must then post their thoughts on a class forum, and also respond to at least one other of their peers posts. The interaction with the students is great, but I can tell many of the students have never thought about the fact that a field they hope to enter is pretty homogeneous. I also like that you value work/life balance. Co-workers who are only into coding are pretty boring, and not much fun to work with. But, well rounded employees are not just more interesting, they have a better perspective on their work add more value to the organization.
