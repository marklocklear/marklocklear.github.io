        I am a mentor, teacher and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/news/instructor-and-student-co-author-web-development-book"  target="_blank">author</a> who uses software development as a powerful <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/"  target="_blank">medium</a> through which I can interact with the world, support others, and share information. I teach <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/csc/java-programming" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/dba/mysql-db-programming-ii"  target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> as an adjunct at my local community college. Over the last twenty years I have held positions as LAN Administrator, QA Engineer, and Web Developer. I still like doing all of those things when the opportunity presents itself. The <a href="http://www.learningrails5.com/foreword"  target="_blank">foreword</a> from <i>Learning Rails 5</i> will give you a sense of how I came to software development. You can get an idea of my skill level by reading my Stackoverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=questions"  target="_blank">Questions</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=answers"  target="_blank">Answers</a>. You can find my most recent development (public) development work <a href="https://github.com/extension/imageaudit/commits?author=marklocklear"  target="_blank">here</a> and more sophisticated work <a href="https://github.com/extension/ask/commits?author=marklocklear"  target="_blank">here</a>. More recently I have been doing more work at my organization in areas of strategic planning and marketing and have began worndering what will be next in my career.

        Outside of software I like just about anything I can do with my hands. I create <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/oJOopOsZ9c"  target="_blank">salvaged metal art</a>; enjoy gardening, <a href="http://locklear.me/motorcycle/index.html"  target="_blank">motorcycle restoration</a>, old <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/bfc83a77-1cac-4da3-bf21-effe1eecb616"  target="_blank">Volkswagens</a> and home brewing (<a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7188999&postcount=8"  target="_blank">muscadine beer</a> anyone?). I love the NFL (Go Panthers) and NBA, but hate baseball (not enough action). I am a <a href="http://www.lumbeetribe.com/"  target="_blank">Lumbee Indian</a> and adore my wife and three year old daughter. I am addicted to the classroom and most recently I am taking a Graphic Design class and am enjoying learning the Adobe Suite of products. I had fun with the InDesign project in the Volkswagen link above.

        You are Zapier. Your software allows regular people (not programmers) to make amazing connections between the apps and devices they use everyday. These connections are called zaps and your software supports over 750 apps, and new ones are being added every week. You use Python along with Django/Flask and also React + Backbone.js. Your primary competetor is IFTTT.

        You are fully remote with about 80 employees. I love that zapier cares about its employees and that you insist they take at least 2 weeks off each year. You care about diverisy and believe that it's not just the right thing to do, but also that diversity allows you to make better software <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/two-writing-assignments-for-new-programmers-ee59175b33a"  target="_blank">(me too!)</a> . I love that your code of conduct, culture and values includes words like empathy, friendly, transparent and respectful.
