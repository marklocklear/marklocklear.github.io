        I am a <a href="http://vetswhocode.io/"  target="_blank">mentor</a>, teacher and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/news/instructor-and-student-co-author-web-development-book"  target="_blank">author</a> who loves software development. Truth be told mentoring and teaching are my passions and software development is only a <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/"  target="_blank">medium</a> for me to accomplish that. However, solving problems and making people happy with code is a close second. I teach <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/csc/java-programming" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/dba/mysql-db-programming-ii"  target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> at my local Community College. Positions I have held over the last 20 years are LAN Administrator, QA Engineer, and most recently Web Developer. I still like doing all of those things when the opportunity presents itself. The <a href="http://www.learningrails5.com/foreword"  target="_blank">foreword</a> from <i>Learning Rails 5</i> will give you a sense of how I came to software development. You can get an idea of my skill level by reading my Stackoverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=questions"  target="_blank">Questions</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=answers"  target="_blank">Answers</a>. Here is my latest <a href="https://bitbucket.org/marklocklear/zoom_managment/"  target="_blank">Rails work</a>, and some more sophisticated (monolith) work <a href="https://github.com/extension/ask/commits?author=marklocklear"  target="_blank">here</a>.

        Outside of software I like just about anything I can do with my hands. I create <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/oJOopOsZ9c"  target="_blank">salvaged metal art</a>, enjoy gardening, <a href="http://locklear.me/motorcycle/index.html"  target="_blank">motorcycle restoration</a>, old <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/bfc83a77-1cac-4da3-bf21-effe1eecb616"  target="_blank">volkswagens</a> and home brewing (<a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7188999&postcount=8"  target="_blank">Muscadine Beer</a> anyone?). I love the NFL (Go Panthers) and NBA, but hate baseball (not enough action). I am a <a href="http://www.lumbeetribe.com/"  target="_blank">Lumbee Indian</a> and adore my wife and three year old daughter. I am addicted to the classroom and most recently I am taking a Graphic Design class and am enjoying learning the Adobe Suite of products. I had fun with the InDesign project in the volkswagen link above.

        You are Basecamp (37Signals). You are THE gold standard for a web development company, and a Rails shop. I would be honored to work with you and be a part of creating great software, inspiring others and making the world a better place. If you are looking for someone to only write code, then I am the wrong candidate. <strong ><font size="5"> If you are looking for someone to contribute to more than your codebase then let's talk. </strong></font>

        I love that Basecamp sees value in diversity and what that can bring to software development. I love that you welcome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"  target="_blank">impostors</a>. I love that that you value work/life balance, and that DHH races at Le Mans (but can he turn a wrench?). Co-workers who are only into coding are pretty boring, and not much fun to work with. Well rounded employees are not just more interesting, they have a better perspective on their work and add more value to an organization.
