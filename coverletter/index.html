        I am a mentor, teacher and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/news/instructor-and-student-co-author-web-development-book"  target="_blank">author</a> who uses software development as a powerful <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/"  target="_blank">medium</a> through which I can interact with the world, support others, and share information. I teach <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/csc/java-programming" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/dba/mysql-db-programming-ii"  target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> as an adjunct at my local community college, AB-Tech. Over the last twenty years I have held positions as LAN Administrator, QA Engineer, and Web Developer. I still like doing all of those things when the opportunity presents itself. The <a href="http://www.learningrails5.com/foreword"  target="_blank">foreword</a> from <i>Learning Rails 5</i> will give you a sense of how I came to software development. You can get an idea of my skill level by reading my Stackoverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=questions"  target="_blank">Questions</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=answers"  target="_blank">Answers</a>. Here is my latest <a href="https://bitbucket.org/marklocklear/zoom_managment/"  target="_blank">Rails work</a>, and more sophisticated (monolith) work <a href="https://github.com/extension/ask/commits?author=marklocklear"  target="_blank">here</a>.

        Outside of software I like just about anything I can do with my hands. I create <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/oJOopOsZ9c"  target="_blank">salvaged metal art</a>; enjoy gardening, <a href="http://locklear.me/motorcycle/index.html"  target="_blank">motorcycle restoration</a>, old <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/bfc83a77-1cac-4da3-bf21-effe1eecb616"  target="_blank">Volkswagens</a> and home brewing (<a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showpost.php?p=7188999&postcount=8"  target="_blank">muscadine beer</a> anyone?). I love the NFL (Go Panthers) and NBA, but hate baseball (not enough action). I am a <a href="http://www.lumbeetribe.com/"  target="_blank">Lumbee Indian</a> and adore my wife and three year old daughter. I am addicted to the classroom and most recently I am taking a Graphic Design class and am enjoying learning the Adobe Suite of products. I had fun with the InDesign project in the Volkswagen link above.

        You are TaxJar. You create software that allows people to manage their state sales tax. You are 100% remote. I would be honored to work with you and be a part of creating great software, inspiring others and making the world a better place. If you are looking for someone to only write code, then I am the wrong candidate. <strong ><font size="5"> If you are looking for someone to contribute to more than your codebase then let's talk. </strong></font>

        I love that TaxJar sees value in work life balance and what that can bring to software development. I love that birthdays are mandatory holidays and that employees are required to take at least two weeks of vaction each year. I love that TaxJar beleives that an employee can never truly succeed unless they are allowed to fail.
