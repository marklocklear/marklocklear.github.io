        I am a mentor, teacher and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/news/instructor-and-student-co-author-web-development-book"  target="_blank">author</a> who uses software development as a powerful <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/"  target="_blank">medium</a> through which I can interact with the world, support others, and share information. I teach <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/csc/java-programming" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/academics/course-descriptions/dba/mysql-db-programming-ii"  target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> as an adjunct at my local community college. Over the last twenty years I have held positions as LAN Administrator, QA Engineer, and Web Developer. I still like doing all of those things when the opportunity presents itself. The <a href="http://www.learningrails5.com/foreword"  target="_blank">foreword</a> from <i>Learning Rails 5</i> will give you a sense of how I came to software development. You can get an idea of my skill level by reading my Stackoverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=questions"  target="_blank">Questions</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/812660/lumbee?tab=answers"  target="_blank">Answers</a>. You can find my most recent development (public) development work <a href="https://github.com/extension/imageaudit/commits?author=marklocklear"  target="_blank">here</a> and more sophisticated work <a href="https://github.com/extension/ask/commits?author=marklocklear"  target="_blank">here</a>.

        You are fully remote with about 76 employees and 8 contractors spread over 22 states. I love that adhoc does <a href="https://adhocteam.us/cohorts/"  target="_blank">user research</a> to make its software better. As a developer it can tough to put yourself <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/the-value-of-eating-your-own-dog-food-40d39ca0777d"  target="_blank">in the users chair</a>. I love that you do periodic retreats that allow employees to meet one another in person, but also to visit some of the places and people you serve. I love that you have made a commitment to diversity <a href="https://medium.com/@marklocklear/two-writing-assignments-for-new-programmers-ee59175b33a"  target="_blank">(me too!)</a> as a priority at you last retreat.
